# BCG-ML-customer-churn
This project is a part of a virtual internship https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/Tcz8gTtprzAS4xSoK?ref=PKWGjcG5S32oGNPqr. The internship is separated into 4 tasks to predict the customer churn using machine-learning algorithms. 

This repository is my log book for the progress and end result of my very first machine-learning project. The user-defined functions for the exploratory data analysis (task 2) have been referred from : https://www.kaggle.com/maartenvandevelde/customer-churn-eda-modelling-92-recall and references from the model work done by BCG.
I will regularly be updating this repository with changes being made in the project until I arrive with an end result for the customer-churn model
