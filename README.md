# BCG-ML-customer-churn
This project is a part of a virtual internship https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/Tcz8gTtprzAS4xSoK?ref=PKWGjcG5S32oGNPqr. The internship is separated into 4 tasks to predict the customer churn using machine-learning algorithms. 

This repository is my log book for the progress and end result of my very first machine-learning project. The user-defined functions for the exploratory data analysis (task 2) have been referred from : https://www.kaggle.com/maartenvandevelde/customer-churn-eda-modelling-92-recall and references from the model work done by BCG.
I will regularly be updating this repository with changes being made in the project until I arrive with an end result for the customer-churn model

An imbalanced data set is quite difficult to handle in a machine learning problem since the minority class is infinitesimal. Although a machine learning model would generate results of high accuracies, it wouldn't be advisable to consider only that, (i.e,) the results would be misleading. It only shows that the model might be able to predict the negative class with the said accuracy but not the positive class. 

Therefore, this project has set a precedent to get more experimental with imbalanced datasets with a good prediction score. 

P.s, The metric of interest in such situations must be the precision-recall score. In the model used in this project, the precision generated is good enough but not the recall. I would assume that it has given in to the precision-recall bias, however, as mentioned earlier, it only sets the stage for more experimentation in similar problems.
